    """Integrate a sampled PSF onto detector pixels. 
    
    This routine takes as input a sampled PSF and integrates it over pixels of a 
    specified size. This is done by convolving the Fourier transform of the input 
    PSF with a sinc function representing the transfer function of an idealized 
    square pixel and transforming back. This result then represents the PSF 
    integrated onto detector-sized pixels with the same sampling as the PSF. 
    The result is interpolated to get detector-sized pixels at detector-pixel 
    spacing.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    image_in : numpy ndarray
        2D floating image containing PSF
        
    sampling_in : float
        Sampling of image_in in meters/pixel
        
    sampling_out : float
        Size(=sampling) of detector pixels
        
    n_out : int
        Output image dimension (n_out by n_out)
        
    Returns
    -------
    new : numpy ndarray
        Returns image integrated over square detector pixels.
