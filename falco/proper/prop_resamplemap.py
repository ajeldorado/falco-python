    Optionally shift the map. The new, resampled map replaces the old one.
    

    Returns
    -------
    dmap : numpy ndarray
        "map" is replaced with a new version of itself that has equal sampling
        as the current wavefront array

        
    Parameters
    ----------
    wf : obj
        WaveFront class object
        
    dmap : numpy ndarray
        Aberration map to be resampled
        
    pixscale : float
        Spacing of "map" in meters
        
    xc, yc : float
        Pixel coordinates of map center (0,0 is center of 1st pixel)
        
    xshift, yshift : float
        Amount of shift map in meters
