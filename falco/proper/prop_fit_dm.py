    Parameters
    ----------
    dm_z : numpy ndarray
        DM surface to match (2D array, with each element representing the 
        desired surface amplitude for the corresponding actuator)
        
    inf_kernel : numpy ndarray
        Influence function kernel (2D image sampled at actuator spacing)
        
    Returns
    -------
    dm_z_command : numpy ndarray
        DM actuator positions that create the desired surface when the influence 
        function is included (2D image) 
        
    dm_surface : numpy ndarray
        dm_z_command array convolved with inf_kernel
