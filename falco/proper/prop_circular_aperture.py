def prop_circular_aperture(wf, radius, xc = 0.0, yc = 0.0, **kwargs):
    """Multiply the wavefront by a circular clear aperture.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    wf : obj
        WaveFront class object
    
    radius : float
       Radius of aperture in meters, unless norm is specified
      
    xc : float
        X-center of aperture relative to center of wavefront. Default is 0.0
        
    yc : float
        Y-center of aperture relative to center of wavefront. Default is 0.0
        
        
    Returns
    -------
    numpy ndarray:
        Multiplies current wavefront in wf object by a circular aperture.
    
    
    Other Parameters
    -----------------
    NORM : bool
        If set to True, the specified radius and xc, yc aperure centers are 
        assumed to be normalized to the current beam radius (e.g. radius is 1.0
        means the aperture is the same size as  the current beam). xc, yc = 0,0 
        is the center of the wavefront. Default is False.
