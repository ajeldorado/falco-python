    """Multiply the current wavefront by a rectangular aperture.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    wf : obj
        WaveFront class object
        
    width, height : float
        X and Y widths of aperture in meters, unless the norm switch is 
        specified, in which case the are normalized to the beam diameter.
        
    xc, yc : float
        Center of aperture relative to the center of the beam in meters (unless 
        norm is specified); the default is (0,0).
    
    
    Returns
    -------
        None
        Multiplies the wavefront array in "wf" object by a rectangular mask.

    
    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    NORM : bool
        Indicates that the given aperture sizes and the centers are normalized 
        to the beam radius.
        
    ROTATION : float
        Angle degrees counter-clockwise to rotate rectangular aperture about 
        its center. Default is 0 degrees.        
    """
