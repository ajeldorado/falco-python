    Parameters
    ----------
    wf : obj
        The current WaveFront class object


    Returns
    -------
    wf.wfarr : numpy ndarray
        Wavefront array

    sampling : float
        Sampling in meters


    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    EXTRACT : int
        Returns the dx by dx pixel central portion of the wavefront.

    NOABS : bool
        If set, the complex-values wavefront field is returned. By default, the
        intensity (modulus squared) of the field is returned.
