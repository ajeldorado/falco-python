    Parameters
    ----------
    wf : obj
        WaveFront class object
        
    width, height : float
        X and Y widths of the obscuration in meters (unless the norm switch is  
        specified, in which case these are normalized to the beam diameter) 
    
    xc, yc : float
        Center of obscuration relative to the center of the beam in meters 
        (unless norm is specified, in which case they are normalized relative 
        to the beam radius; the default is (0,0)
        
        
    Returns
    -------
        None
        Multiplies the wavefront array in "wf" object by a dark rectangular mask.

    
    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    NORM : bool
        Indicates that obscuration halfwidths and center are specified relative 
        to the beam radius.
        
    ROTATION : float
        Degrees counter-clockwise to rotate obscuration about its center.
