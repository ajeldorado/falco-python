def prop_run(routine_name, lambda0, gridsize, **kwargs):
    """Execute a prescription.

    Parameters
    ----------
    routine_name : str
        Filename (excluding extension) of the python routine containing the
        prescription.

    lambda0 : float
        Either the wavelength in microns at which to propagate the wavefront,
        or the name of a text file containing a list of wavelength and weight
        pairs. In the latter case, the prescription is run for each wavelength
        and the results added together with the respective weights.

    gridsize : int
        Size of the computational grid (arrays are gridsize by gridsize). Must
        be power of 2.


    Returns
    -------
    psf : numpy ndarray
        Image containing result of the propagation pf the prescription routine.

    pixscale : float
        Returns sampling of "result" in meters per element.  It is the
        responsibility of the prescription to return this value (which is
        returned from function end).


    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    QUIET : bool
        If set, intermediate messages and surface labels will not be printed.

    PHASE_OFFSET : bool
        If set, a phase offset is added as the wavefront is propagated. For
        instance, if a wavefront is propagated over a distance of 1/4 wavelength,
        a phase offset of pi/2 radians will be added. This is useful in cases
        where the offset between separate beams that may be combined later may
        be important (e.g. the individual arms of an interferometer). By default,
        a phase offset is not applied.

    VERBOSE : bool
        If set, informational messages will be printed.

    PASSVALUE : dict
        Points to a value (which could be a constant or a variable) that is
        passed to the prescription for use as the prescription desires.

    TABLE : bool
        If set, prints out a table of sampling and beam size for each surface.

    IS_MULTI: bool
        If set, signifies that this instance of prop_run is running as an instance
        of multiple prop_run processes.  This is only meant to be used by
        prop_execute_multi.

    PRINT_INTENSITY : bool
        If set, print intensity values
    """
